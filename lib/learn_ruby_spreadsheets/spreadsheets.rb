    Working with rubyXL
    workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse("path/to/xlsx")
    workbook.write("path/to/desired/Excel/file.xlsx")

    work_sheet = workbook[0]
    sheetByName = workbook['sheet_name'] this will find matching sheet

    row1 = work_sheet[0]
    workbook[0][0]

    cell1 = row1[0]
    workbook[0][0][0]
    work_sheet[0][0]

    cell_value = cell1.value to read the cell value
    cell_value.change_contents("new value") to change the cell value the quotes insert data as string, leave off for int
    cell_value.change_contents("new value", cell_value.formula) to preserve the formula
    cylinderSheet[target_row][5].change_contents("", "SUM(2+2)") Creates a blank cell (this could be replaced with real data), and adds the formula
            I can't seem to get the formula to evaluate for the value of the cell for some reason 
            My solution is to:
            - use Ruby to evaluate the same data that the formula is meant to evaluate
            - pass that data in as the first argument of .change_contents
            - pass the excel formula as the second argument
            This will ensure that the cell value is the same as what the formula would evaluate to while allowing for the formula to
            be copied and pasted directly in the spreadsheet should action be performed.
            

    row.cells returns array-like object of all cells
    row.cells.each lets me itterate over all the cells to pull out values

    worksheet.each iterates over all rows starting from the first
    worksheet.reverse_each iterates over all rows starting from the last
        the rows are still read from left to right

    cylinderSheet.each do |row| This will print out the qty of each row if it has a qty and a serial, otherwise the row is skipped
        puts row[qty].value if row && row[qty] && row[serial].value  
    end

    .r Gives the actual row which are numbered starting from 1
    cylinderSheet[index] is how I manipulate rows and it is numbered starting from 0
    target_row = last_row_with_data.r This will let me target a specific row
        cylinderSheet[target_row].cells.each.with_index do |cell, index| This will let me copy the values from each cell one row into the cells of another row
            cell.change_contents(last_row_with_data[index].value)
